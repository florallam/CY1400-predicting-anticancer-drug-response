The folder 'Data' consists of the data that were used to build the models 
The main folder of interest is the brca_main.ipynb

The following are the file names and what information they contain:
1) DrugData.csv 
- data extracted from GDSC containing drug performance with BRCA cell lines

2) DrugData_coread.csv 
- data extracted from GDSC containing drug performance with COREAD cell lines

3) GDSC2_fitted_dose_response_15Oct19.xlsx 
- the initial file sent to me by Dr. Rama to extract the relevant information

4) cyinputdata_copy 
- chose a particular cell line from the BRCA list (CAL-51) with the drug id, ic50, smiles and fingerprints

5) drug_smiles.csv 
- sent to me by Dr. Rama when the file from my initial code returned one/two less drugs

6) rdkit_fp_copy.csv 
-processing of SMILES to include the fingerprints

7) compounds_pubchem.csv
-contains the SMILES, pubchem ID, molecular weight

8)compound_data6dec2019.csv
-contains the pubchem ID and drug ID
