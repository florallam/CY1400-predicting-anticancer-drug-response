This file consists of the codes that were used to build the three different models: 
Linear regression, Random forest and support vector regression

The file brca_revised.ipynb was modified to include Lasso regression and SVR-RFE for feature selection. 

For brca_main.ipynb,
The models were first built using breast cancer data, then re-tested on coread cancer data in the file coread_test.ipynb

The main concern/problem at the end is the calculation of accuracy levels. The code that was used involved mape.
This was a problem as the accuracy levels were over 100. 
But R^2 was used to create an accuracy score (where 1 is a good model and 0 is a bad model) would be really low

CY1400-drug_smiles contains the code I used previously for combining the datasets, but there were *errors*,
so Dr. Rama provided me her data file after I was done creating mine
