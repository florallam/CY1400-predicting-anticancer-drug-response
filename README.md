# CY1400 Research Project: Predicting Anticancer Drug Response from Drug Chemical Features (Jan 2020-Apr 2020) <br>
## Overview <br>
This research project involves applying supervised learning models such as random forest, linear regression, support vector regression to predict the IC50 values of anticancer drugs using features extracted from chemical fingerprints. Feature selection is also conducted using random forest to select the top 100 key features as the chemical fingerprints have a high dimensionality.<br>
## Background <br>
Chemical fingerprints are binary features that quantify chemical features present in drug. For example, the presence of double bonds, surrounding chemical compounds. Different chemical fingerprints extract different chemical features present in the drug. Using the chemical features extracted, they are being used to predict the IC50 values (also known as half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of the anticancer drugs, quantifies the potency of the anticancer drug in inhibiting a biological process or activity. <br>
